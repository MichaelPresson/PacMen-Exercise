# PacMen-Exercise
#Description
In this project we made a pacmen factory using arrays and callback functions to manipulate images of pacmen to populate when a button is pressed and then move freely and bounce off of the borders once another button is pressed.

#How to Run
Start by cloning this repository.
Open the file using VS Code or whichever code editor you use.
Launch the file in the browser and press the "Add PacMan" button to populate your desired about of PacMen and the press the "Start Game" button.

#Roadmap
In the future I would like to add the functionality for the pacmen to be animated and switch directions when bouncing off of walls.
